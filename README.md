## Error 404 Design ##
Upload the custom 404 error page to your website's root directory or to a specific directory where you want the error page to appear.

Edit the .htaccess file: Open the .htaccess file in a text editor and add the following code:

```
ErrorDocument 404 /error.html
```
error.html is your HTML file containing custom code.

## Adding a custom 404 error page to your website can provide several benefits, including: ##

1. Improved user experience: A custom 404 page can help retain visitors who may have otherwise left the site due to a broken link or missing page.

2. Branding opportunities: By designing a custom page that aligns with your website's branding, you can strengthen your brand identity and make a positive impression on users.

3. Better SEO: A well-designed 404 page can help improve your website's search engine optimization (SEO) by providing relevant content and links to other pages on your site.

4. Analytics tracking: Custom 404 pages can also include tracking code to monitor user behavior and identify any recurring errors or broken links.

5. Professionalism: A generic or default 404 error page can appear unprofessional and leave a negative impression on visitors, while a custom page demonstrates attention to detail and a commitment to user experience.
